DESCRIPTION :

A student grade tracker in Java is a valuable application for managing academic performance. This project allows for the input, storage, and analysis of grades across various subjects. The Student Grade Tracker assists educators and students in tracking academic performance efficiently. It offers functionalities for adding, updating, and viewing student grades while calculating key metrics like GPA and subject averages. Secure login and registration for users ensure data protection. Users can add, update, and delete student details, such as name, ID, and class. Grades for subjects and assessments (exams, quizzes, assignments) can be entered, edited, and deleted as needed.

The application calculates GPA based on entered grades and computes average grades per subject. It generates individual student grade reports and provides class-wide performance statistics. A user-friendly GUI, using Swing or JavaFX, facilitates easy navigation and accurate grade entry through data validation. Data storage is managed using arrays, ArrayLists, or a database (e.g., SQLite). Classes such as `Student`, `Grade`, and `Subject` are created, implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for these entities. Methods for GPA and average grade calculations are implemented using loops and conditionals to process data.

The technologies and tools used include Java as the programming language and development environments like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans. Databases such as SQLite or MySQL are used for persistent storage, and the GUI library utilized is Swing or JavaFX. The Student Grade Tracker in Java is a comprehensive application that efficiently manages student grades and provides insightful data to improve academic performance tracking. This project enhances skills in object-oriented programming, data management, and GUI development in Java.

CONCLUSION :

In conclusion, the Student Grade Tracker in Java is an effective tool for managing and analyzing academic performance. It enhances the efficiency of tracking grades, calculating GPAs, and generating performance reports. This project strengthens skills in object-oriented programming, data management, and GUI development. By utilizing this application, educators and students can streamline academic performance monitoring, ultimately improving educational outcomes. The implementation of secure, user-friendly features ensures accurate and protected data management.
